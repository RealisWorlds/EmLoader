# Enhanced Prompter Migration Guide

This guide explains how to migrate from the current `prompter.js` implementation to the enhanced version that improves reliability, reduces disconnections, and implements more efficient design patterns.

## Overview of Improvements

The enhanced prompter implementation addresses several key issues:

1. **Robust Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Comprehensive try/catch blocks around all API operations
   - Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Graceful fallback to alternative models when primary models fail

2. **State Management**
   - Implements a finite state machine to prevent state corruption
   - Clear transitions between processing states
   - Automatic recovery from error states

3. **Resource Management**
   - Connection pooling to maintain stable API connections
   - Request timeouts to prevent hanging operations
   - Cooldown management to prevent API rate limiting

4. **Memory System Enhancements**
   - Caching layer to reduce redundant vector searches
   - High relevance threshold (0.85) as per your existing customization
   - Timeout protection for memory operations

5. **Service-Oriented Architecture**
   - Decoupled components with clear responsibilities
   - Event-based communication between services
   - Better testability and maintainability

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Install the New Files

The enhanced implementation consists of the following new files:

- `src/models/enhanced_prompter.js` - Main implementation
- `src/models/prompter_adapter.js` - Backward compatibility adapter
- `src/models/services/state_manager.js` - State machine implementation
- `src/models/services/event_bus.js` - Event management
- `src/models/services/model_service.js` - Model connection management
- `src/models/services/memory_service.js` - Enhanced memory operations
- `src/models/services/prompt_service.js` - Prompt template management

### Step 2: Testing Strategy (Recommended)

Before replacing the main implementation, you can test the enhanced version:

1. Create a new agent profile that uses the enhanced prompter:

```javascript
// In your agent creation code
import { createPrompter } from './src/models/prompter_adapter.js';

// Instead of directly creating a Prompter instance:
// const prompter = new Prompter(agent, profilePath);

// Use the adapter function:
const prompter = createPrompter(agent, profilePath);
```

2. Test this agent with the enhanced prompter to ensure it works correctly

### Step 3: Full Migration

Once you're satisfied with the testing, you can fully migrate:

1. Back up your existing `prompter.js`:
```
cp src/models/prompter.js src/models/prompter.js.bak
```

2. Replace it with the enhanced version:
```
cp src/models/enhanced_prompter.js src/models/prompter.js
```

3. Or use the adapter approach for a gentler transition:
```javascript
// In prompter.js
export { Prompter } from './prompter_adapter.js';
```

## Verifying the Migration

After migration, monitor the following:

1. Check console logs for improved error handling messages
2. Monitor connection stability and disconnection frequency
3. Observe memory system performance and relevance of retrieved memories
4. Verify that the high relevance threshold (0.85) is still enforced

## Rollback Procedure

If you encounter issues, you can easily roll back:

```
cp src/models/prompter.js.bak src/models/prompter.js
```

## Additional Customization

The enhanced implementation offers several configuration points:

- Adjust retry counts and backoff factors in `ModelService`
- Modify timeout durations for different operations
- Change the memory cache TTL (currently 60 seconds)
- Adjust the relevance threshold (currently set to 0.85 as per your preference)

## Performance Monitoring

To verify that the implementation is working correctly:

1. Monitor CPU and memory usage
2. Check API connection stability
3. Measure response times for different operations
4. Review error logs for frequency and patterns

The enhanced implementation should significantly reduce disconnections while maintaining or improving the functionality of your agent.
